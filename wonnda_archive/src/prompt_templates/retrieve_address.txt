Extract only the official, complete address of the company '{company_name}' from the company’s website, checking
sections like ‘Contact Us’, ‘About Us’, or 'Legal Notice'. The address should be formatted for use in Google Maps,
including street, city, postal code, and country if available. If a complete, Google Maps-compatible address is found,
output it in a single line with no extra text. If no suitable address is found, leave the output completely blank, with
no placeholders or alternative text. Constrain the search to exclusively the following domain: '{domain}'. In case
addresses from multiple countries are found, return the address from '{country}'.
